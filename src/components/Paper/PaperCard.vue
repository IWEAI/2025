            This workshop is a good venue to discuss and explore the transformative impact of AI in the area of education. We invite researchers, educators, and practitioners with interests in this area to share their work and opinions. We welcome any work that studies or discusses using advanced AI technology to reshape or improve current educational practice, such as using AI to create instructional contents, to provide students with learning assistance, to personalize their learning experiences, to trace their learning process, to build effective learning systems, and any other topics related. While no submission is required for participating in this workshop, we do accept abstracts that are 1-2 pages in length.
